# Focus Timer
This is a timer project that I made using JavaScript HMTL and CSS.

# How it works
In this timer you can set the minutes you want by clicking the plus button, it will add 5 more minutes. Or clicking in the minus button to decrease 5 minutes.</br>
The play button triggers the alarm, and you can pause when you like.</br>
If you want some background music you can choose from nature sound (tree button), rain sound (cloud button), coffee shop sound (shop button) or a fireplace sound (fire button). And in the bar you can set the volumn.</br>
You can also change to dark mode clicking in the sun.</br>
